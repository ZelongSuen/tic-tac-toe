1. What does getCell(int row, int col) return if you pass invalid coordinates like (-1, 5)?
   Based on the implementation in TicTacToe.cpp, getCell() performs bounds checking. If invalid coordinates are passed, it returns the null character ('\0').

2. What does getWinner() return when there's no winner yet?
   When there is no winner yet (either because the game is in progress or it ended in a tie), getWinner() returns the space character (' ').

3. Explain why getWinner() is marked const but makeMove() is not.
   getWinner() is marked `const` because it is an "accessor" method. It only reads the game's state (the board) to check for a winner but does not modify any member variables. makeMove() is not `const` because it is a "mutator" method; it actively changes the object's state by placing a mark on the board, updating `currentPlayer`, and incrementing `moveCount`.

4. If the board is full but nobody has won, what should isGameOver() return?
   If the board is full and nobody has won (a tie game), isGameOver() should return `true`.

5. What value does getCurrentPlayer() return at the start of a new game?
   At the start of a new game, getCurrentPlayer() returns 'X', as 'X' always makes the first move.
